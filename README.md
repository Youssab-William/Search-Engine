# Advanced_Search_Engine_System
The purpose of this project is to build a search engine, like Google, to take a string 
input from the user and outputs the relevant websites for his keywords. The 
websites should be sorted according to the score of each website. The score has 
several variables that change its value with the userâ€™s interactions. The number of 
clicks, number of views, and page rank of the webpages are the three variables that 
enter into calculating the final score.

In the project report, I will illustrate more on the main data structures used for implementing 
the project, how is the search engine implemented in C++, and the time complexity for indexing and ranking 
algorithms.
